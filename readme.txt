== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Why install? = 

90% of the 25,466 infected websites collected and analyzed by GoDaddy and Sucuri in 2018 were WordPress based sites. ([https://sucuri.net/reports/2018-hacked-website-report/](https://sucuri.net/reports/2018-hacked-website-report/))

CodeNotary does the heavy lifting for you and verifies each file you offer for download by ensuring its fingerprints (aka it’s hash) match the fingerprints you originally saved for that respective file. 

The benefit for you as a site owner is it’s one less thing you have to worry about. For your downloaders, they can feel at ease knowing they are protected downloading from your site.
